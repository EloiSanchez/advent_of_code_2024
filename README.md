# AoC 2024

Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, a speed contest, or to challenge each other.

## About me

2024 was the first time I actively participated with the intention to solve as many puzzles as possible by myself. It has been a great experience of learning lots of new algorithms, datastructures and ideas that I had not encountered before:

Some noteworthy mentions:

- Pathfinding and Tree/Graph navigation: 10, 12, 23, 16, 18, 20, 21, 23
  - Breadth First Search
  - Dijkstra
- Caching: 11, 19, 21
- Optimization: 13
- Recursion: A lot of them
- Pattern finding: 2, 3, 4
- Dynamic programming: Almost everything
- Sorting: 9
